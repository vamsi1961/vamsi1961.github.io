4. Electric vehicle simulation in Matlab [[code]](https://github.com/vamsi1961/Electric_vehicle):


<ul>
<li>Mathematical modelling of Electric vehicle. </li>
<li>FOC Algorithm and SVPWM method for PMSM. </li>
<li> Developed custom Vehicle and Brake Control Units. </li>
<li> Tested with UDDS drive cycle. </li>
</ul>



5. SOC estimation of cell with Kalman Filter[[code]](https://github.com/vamsi1961/Cell-KalmanFilter): 


<ul>

<li> A more accurate battery state of charge estimation method for electric vehicles is developed based on a nonlinear cell model and an Extended Kalman Filter supported by open source experimental data </li>
<li> A nonlinear cell model is constructed by separating the model into
a nonlinear open circuit voltage and a second order resistance-capacitance model </li>
<li>  Extended Kalman Filter is used to eliminate the measurement and process noise </li>
<li> The algorithm also removes the need of prior knowledge of initial state of charge </li>
<li> Temperature variations that occur in a real world scenario are considered by obtaining model parameters from pulse discharge tests which are conducted at different standard temperatures and current ratings</li>
<li> The developed algorithm is tested under a variety of standard drive cycles and optimized for maximum efficiency</li>


</ul>
