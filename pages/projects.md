## **Work Experience - Professional /Internships**

# **Capgemini**


**AI-Driven Agile Workflow Automation**

- **Efficiency Impact**: Our current product increases the efficiency of Scrum Masters by ~45% in large teams and ~30% in small teams.
- **Profile**: Results-driven **Senior Python Developer** with expertise in AI-driven automation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Crew AI, and AI security using **Flask**, **ChromaDB**, **Azure GPT API**, and **Azure DevOps**.
- **Current Work**: Leading initiatives in **document intelligence**, **Azure Board automation via RAG**, **chatbot evaluation**, and **workflow optimization** for both **efficiency** and **security**.


### Agile Intelligence

- **Automation System**: Developed a GPT-driven system to automate Agile artifacts (Epics, Features, User Stories, Test Cases, Personas, and Tasks) with a structured, scalable approach.
- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Structured & Few-shot prompting for consistency.
  - Role-based prompting for stakeholder alignment.
  - Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting for test case generation.
- **Task Planning**: Applied **hierarchical decomposition** for systematic task breakdown to enhance Agile planning.


### Doc Intelligence

- **InsightFlow**:
  - Implemented **iterative summarization** for processing both structured and unstructured documents.
  - Used **semantic chunking** and a **fixed-length sliding window** (70k tokens, 20% overlap) to handle documents with over 30,000 words while preserving context.

- **Ask Doc**:
  - For **structured documents**: Used **semantic chunking**.
  - For **unstructured text**: Used **fixed-length chunking** with overlap.
  - Combined retrieved vector chunks with document summary to generate accurate responses via **GPT API**.


### Deduplication

- Built a **vector database-powered deduplication system** to identify and link similar test cases in Azure DevOps.
- Used **semantic similarity** via embeddings of titles and descriptions to find related test cases above a similarity threshold.
- Achieved **automated traceability** and **optimized test coverage**.


### Root Cause Analysis for Bugs

- Designed a **RAG-based RCA system** using **ChromaDB** to retrieve relevant tasks and user stories.
- Used **role-based prompting** (Developer, QA, PM) to identify failure points, significantly improving debugging efficiency.


### Test Case Prioritization

- Parsed and analyzed **10,000+ test cases** from Azure DevOps to assign **Complexity**, **Dependency**, and **Criticality** scores using **Azure GPT API**.
- Employed **async function calls** for parallel processing, improving scoring speed by **5x**.
- Integrated **Few-shot prompting** and **CoT prompting** for accurate test case evaluation.


### Response Shield AI

- **Multi-turn Testing**: Validates chatbot behavior across full conversations.
- Measures **answer relevancy**, **bias**, **toxicity**, and **hallucinations** to ensure **coherent**, **responsible**, and **ethical** AI responses.

## Life Insurance Prediction

- Developed a **production-ready pipeline** to predict life insurance premiums using personal, health, and financial data, delivering **fast and accurate predictions** with **LightGBM**.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied **correlation analysis** and domain expertise to reduce the feature set from 18 to 14 by creating task-specific features while preserving predictive power.
- Used **SHAP values** to validate model interpretability for stakeholders, ensuring transparency and trust in predictions.
- **Model Benchmarking**: Evaluated **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, and **GradientBoosting**; selected **LightGBM** for its superior accuracy and performance.
