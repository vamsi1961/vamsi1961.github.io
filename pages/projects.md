### **At Tiger Analytics as ML Engineer**


**Bug Risk Prediction**
<ul>
<li>
Deployed a model to predict out of sprint bugs using Jira Data.
</li>

## **Projects - Academic/Personal**
    
1. Automation of Cleaning cervical data using deep learning techniques:

    Developed a supervised contrastive model to filter outliers in a cervical image dataset resulted in superior performance when compared to human cleaning. These impressive findings were published in the prestigious IEEE Access journal.
        
2. EfficientCenterDet: A novel Self supervision boosted RoI proposal network for cervix type detection [[code]](https://github.com/mano3-1/EfficientCenterDet-for-cervix-type-detection):

    A fully automated self-supervised pipeline has been developed for the detection of cervical cancer. This impressive feat was achieved by leveraging a novel object detector, which drew inspiration from both the efficientdet architecture and centrenet loss. These impressive findings were published in the prestigious International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology.

        
        
3. Covid-19 detection from CT scans [[code]](https://github.com/mano3-1/Covid-detection-with-CT-scans):
    
    I successfully designed and implemented an advanced EfficientNet architecture that accurately predicts Covid-19 infection through CT scans. To ensure optimal performance, I employed a BCD U-net for efficient segmentation of the region of interest. These findings were communicate to a conference.


        
4. Cassava Leaf disease classification [[code]](https://www.kaggle.com/saimanojakondi/the-cassava/notebook):
        
    I undertook a challenging Kaggle competition by implementing a variety of advanced models, including Vision Transformer, EfficientNets, and ResNets, all trained using Bi-Tempered Loss.
