Data collection is inherently error-prone, often necessitating pre-processing before feeding it into machine learning models. Our paper introduces a pioneering approach to data cleaning through self-supervised learning. What sets this method apart is not only its effectiveness in cleansing datasets but also its ability to train models with few-shot capabilities, enhancing their adaptability.

<ul>    
Cervical cancer, a significant global health concern, inspired us to create an advanced detection model, EfficientCenterDet, employing self-supervision techniques. This model outperforms traditional methods by achieving a remarkable 10% improvement in accuracy on MobileODT cervical data. Additionally, our approach significantly enhances cervical type classification, reaching an impressive accuracy rate of 87%.

<ul>    
The global COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the need for quick and reliable diagnostic tools. Our solution leverages deep learning algorithms, particularly the EfficientNet architecture, to detect COVID-19 from CT scans with a 10% accuracy boost compared to ResNet. We're on a mission to deploy this as a chatbot, continuously improving its accuracy through ongoing learning.
